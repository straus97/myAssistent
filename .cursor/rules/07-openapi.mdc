# Rule: OpenAPI (API‑First)

**Scope:** API contract drives implementation & stories.  
**Outcome:** single source of truth spec with CI validation.

## Process
- Draft OAS first; generate mocks; derive user stories & tests from spec.
- Keep tags, components, examples, and error schemas up to date.

## Acceptance
- Every PR touching endpoints updates OAS and sample payloads.
- CI: lint spec, generate clients/servers, publish docs.

## Do
- Use realistic examples; document auth flows and scopes.
## Don’t
- Merge breaking changes without version bump and changelog.
