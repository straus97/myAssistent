# Rule: shadcn/ui + Radix

**Scope:** accessible component primitives and patterns.  
**Outcome:** consistent UI kit with tokens and variants.

## Principles
- Generate components once; keep them in `components/ui` with local styling.
- Respect Radix a11y primitives; avoid overriding focus/aria behavior.

## Do
- Centralize variants (cva) and tokens; document usage examples.
## Don’t
- Fork components ad-hoc—update via generator and controlled diffs.
