# Rule: Tailwind CSS

**Scope:** styling system for web UI.  
**Outcome:** consistent, responsive design via utility classes.

## Principles
- Utility-first; mobile-first; design tokens via Tailwind config.
- No `@apply` in production; compose small, readable class strings.
- Dark mode via class strategy; respect a11y contrast.

## Do
- Extract UI patterns into components (with Shadcn/Radix), keep layout utilities local.
## Don’t
- Deeply nest arbitrary values—extend theme instead.
