# Rule: TypeScript (Frontend/Node)

**Scope:** type-safe UI and services.  
**Outcome:** clean, maintainable TS with strict typing.

## Principles
- `strict` mode; prefer `interface`; avoid `any` and `enum` (use unions/maps).
- Named exports; functional programming; early returns.
- Clear naming: `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canSubmit`.

## Do
- Utility types (Partial/Pick/Omit), generics where useful, Zod for runtime validation.
## Don’t
- Mix domain and UI types—keep shared types in a `@app/common` package.
