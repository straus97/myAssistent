# Rule: Testing & QA

**Scope:** unit, integration, E2E, performance, and contract tests.  
**Outcome:** reliable CI with fast feedback and clear failures.

## Strategy
- Unit tests for pure logic (table-driven where apt). 
- Integration tests for DB/cache/queues; E2E with Playwright for web flows.
- Contract tests from OpenAPI; smoke tests for health endpoints.

## Tooling
- Python: pytest + coverage; JS: Jest/RTL + Playwright; Go/Ruby as needed.
- Observability in tests: record traces for flaky path analysis.

## Do
- Arrange‑Act‑Assert; parallelize; seed data via factories.
## Don’t
- Use brittle selectors—prefer roles/testids; avoid fixed sleeps.
