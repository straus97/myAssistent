# Rule: React

**Scope:** reusable UI components and pages.  
**Outcome:** predictable, accessible components with minimal re-renders.

## Principles
- Functional components + hooks; custom hooks for shared logic.
- Keep components small; prop interfaces explicit; a11y first (roles/labels).

## Performance
- Memoize expensive work (`useMemo`, `useCallback`), defer non-critical code with `lazy` + `Suspense`.

## Do
- Meaningful keys; controlled forms (React Hook Form + Zod).
## Don’t
- Inline heavy functions in JSX; avoid index as key.
